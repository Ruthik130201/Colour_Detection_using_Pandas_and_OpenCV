# Colour_Detection_using_Pandas_and_OpenCV

In this Python project with source code, I learned about colors and how we can extract color RGB values and the color name of a pixel.

I also learned how to handle events like double-clicking on the window and saw how to read CSV files with pandas and perform operations on data. This is used in numerous image editing and drawing apps.
